# TTP

## What is?
TTP stands for Tarefas, Trabalhos e Provas (Homeworks, Courseworks and Tests). It's a simple task manager that divides tasks in three categories.

## How can i use it?
### Setup
It's been a while so I don't remember how to setup things and databases. But you'll need an apache distribution (I don't know if it works for anything but XAMPP).
### Usage
Actually, I don't remember eihter. But it should be intuitive, since I made this for my friends. Probably you just click some buttons and add things to the list.

## Licence
None. Feel free to use it and redistribute as you want.
